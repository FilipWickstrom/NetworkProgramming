Network Programming

This is from a course when I learned Network programming.
We learned to use TCP and UDP between a server and multiple clients. 
The code was written in C/C++ for Linux and is not the best, I'm still learning and trying to get better.
But I'm kind of proud of Lab4, lots of code but it does what is supposed to.
